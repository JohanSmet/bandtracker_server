# BandTracker Server

The server component for [BandTracker](https://github.com/JohanSmet/bandtracker), an app I developed as part of the Udacity iOS Developer NanoDegree I completed in 2015.

It's a node.js program written in TypeScript using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework and [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to access a MongoDB database.
